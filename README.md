# gsjackctl â€“ GNOME Shell JACK Control

_I'm not actively working on this extension anymore since I personally switched to PipeWire, however if there are people using it I'll try to keep it updated for new gnome-shell versions and will accept bugfix PRs!_

## About
**gsjackctl** is a simple GNOME extension to control the JACK audio system. It works only with jack2 using jackdbus.
